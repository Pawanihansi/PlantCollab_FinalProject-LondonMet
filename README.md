The agriculture sector is a vital part of the Sri Lankan economy. However, the plantation industry in Sri Lanka faces several challenges that are affecting its growth and sustainability. Planters are experiencing difficulties in communicating with plantation factories, which is causing problems in the industry.  Therefore, there is a need for a solution that can bridge the communication gap between planters and the plantation industry, as well as provide access to information and technology to improve the industry's growth.

Web applications have become popular in recent years due to the growth of information technology. They offer a platform-independent solution that can be accessed by anyone with an internet connection or a smartphone.

As a student of computer science, I am motivated to undertake this project to help solve a real-world problem faced by the plantation industry in Sri Lanka. I believe that the project will provide valuable experience in developing a web application and a mobile application that can help to improve the lives of people in the agriculture sector.
